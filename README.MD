# Pyrolysis Material Analyzer

A web application that analyzes uploaded images to determine whether the material is suitable for pyrolysis. This project uses **YOLOv5** for object detection and identifies specific plastic-related objects to assess suitability.

---

## Features

- Upload images and detect objects for pyrolysis suitability.
- Displays results with celebratory emojis for suitable materials or red flags for unsuitable ones.
- Built with **Flask**, **YOLOv5**, and **HTML/CSS** for a seamless interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv5 (pretrained on COCO dataset)
- **Dependencies**: Torch, PIL, NumPy
